    </div>

    <p>Being young and naive, I started to write web pages in the late 1990s. One of them was the first website of the Human Resources Department at Tsinghua University. A benefit of working for HR is that you could see job openings earlier than other people. My wife got her first job at Tsinghua this way.</p>

    <p>As time goes by, I have been always amazed by the evolution of technology. Pursuit of knowledge makes me happy, and I would like to share this happiness with the younger generation.</p>

    <p>Modern web pages are built with HTML for the structure and content, CSS for the styles and presentation, and JavaScript for the dyanmic effects and interactions. This tutorial focuses on JavaScript.</p>

    <p>After a brief introduction in chapter 1 and basic concepts in chapter 2, we will learn variables and operators in chapters 3 and 4, strings and arrays in chapters 5--7. After control flows in chapters 8 and 9 introduce control flows, we will learn advanced arrays. Chapter 11--14 introduce advanced concepts of functions, events and objects. Chpater 15 presents best pratices of JavaScript programming, and chapter 16 resources and tools.</p>
