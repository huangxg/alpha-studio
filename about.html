      <h1>About</h1>
    </div>

    <p>I had never touched a computer before college, but I learned binary numbers from an entry level computer book of my father. Basic programming language on Apple II gave me a hard time when I was a freshman. The computer lab was always crowded, difficult to find a computer to practice.</p>

    <p>Another student and I got an IBM 8086 from a professor for our final year projects. It had 512k memory, four hard disk drives, 10m each. Since then, I have been working or playing on computers about 8 hours per day, 7 days a week, 50 weeks a year. I enjoy being a computerman.</p>

    <p>As time goes by, I have been always amazed by the evolution of technology. Pursuit of knowledge makes me happy, and I would like to share this happiness with the younger generation.</p>

    <p>When I first started programming, C and C++ dominated. Later Java, JavaScript and Python joined the party. JavaScript seems the easiest in these major five. To learn JavaScript, you had better to know a little HTML and CSS.HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be used to lay a foundation for children before they start more serious programmming. In the future, Alpha Studio may provide courses of Java and Python as well.</p>

    <p>Alpha is my English name. It wouldn't sound so weird if you knew my first English name Pentium. I love the board game Go, and wrote a program for it in Java in 2006. Guess what, I named it AlphaGo. I should apply for a trade name, years ahead of Google DeepMind.</p>

    <p>I think computer programming is an art, hence picked the Studio part. Academy seems too serious.</p>

    <p>To family.</p>
